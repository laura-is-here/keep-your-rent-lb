## You can't be evicted

On April 6th, 2020, the California Judicial Concil barred courts from
starting hearings for evictions until 90 days after the state of emergency
in California is ended.<sup>[1](https://newsroom.courts.ca.gov/news/judicial-council-adopts-new-rules-to-lower-jail-population-suspend-evictions-and-foreclosures)</sup>

  <strong>Background:</strong> The so-called State of California declared a
  state of emergency on <strong>March 4th, 2020</strong> in response to the
  pandemic COVID-19. <strong>On March 15th, 2020,</strong> Governor Newsom
  ordered all bars, breweries, and wineries in the state to close, regardless of
  their size, for an indeterminate amount of time. The order also suggested
  restaurants cut their occupancies by 50% and transition to a take-out model.
  The next day, LA County issued a "stay at home" order mandating all residents
  to remain at home and away from others through mid April. This order has been
  extended through the end of May as of <strong>April 10th, 2020.</strong>

## Tenants have the power

Because your landlord can't start an eviction process, you are not legally required to provide any documentation or proof of income loss to your landlord. Notify your landlord within 7 days of your rent due date that you can't pay. _Don't sign anything your landlord presents to you without first consulting a lawyer._

  <strong>Background:</strong> On March 25 the City of LB issued an emergency
  eviction moratorium related to COVID-19. It states that no rent is required to
  be paid through May 31 if a household has lost income due to the pandemic. The
  city has also worked out a deal with banks to stop mortgage payments. Our
  Mayor said this: “We’re just starting to see the economic impacts of COVID-19
  on our residential and commercial tenants in Long Beach. The emergency
  ordinance enacted by the City Council should provide relief to those who are
  most vulnerable to eviction and possible homelessness during this difficult
  time.” California Governor Newsom issued a similar order barring enforcement
  of evictions. However, the California Judicial Council felt Newsom's order
  fell short of protecting tenants, as Newsom's order requires tenants to{" "}
  <strong>prove</strong> a loss of income occurred, as does the order here in
  Long Beach. The Judicial Council, on the other hand, has made sure that
  eviction hearings will not take place during the pandemic, thereby increasing
  protections for all tenants.

## Food not rent

With millions unemployed or underpaid due to the pandemic, landlords understand that they're forcing people to choose between rent and other necessities like food or medicine. _**Can't pay? Don't pay!**_
